            <h2>More about me</h2>
            <p>I'm a qualified machining mechanic and cnc programmer, and I'm currently working with KUKA robots.
                I work 3 shifts and in my free time I try to learn as much as possible frontend development by making
                different projects, taking courses and watching videos.
            </p>
            <p>
                I got into frontend development after seeing some projects done by a friend of mine. I really liked the
                idea of creating websites and making a living out of it, so I bought a course from <a
                    href="https://www.udemy.com/user/coltsteele/" target="_blank"><strong>Colt Steele on
                        Udemy</strong></a>,
                where he was teaching us the basics of html, css and Javascript.
                Then I started trying to do some websites on my own, which where far from perfect but it was a start.
                Realising that I needed different oppinions on my coding skills and I needed to get better, I started
                lookin for other courses, and I'm glad I did, because I found a course from <a
                    href="https://www.brainnest.consulting/" target="_blank"><strong>Brainnest</strong></a>,
                where I have learnt alot.
            </p>
            <p><strong>
                    I would really love to work as a junior frontend developer, learn more and gather more experience by
                    your side.</strong>
